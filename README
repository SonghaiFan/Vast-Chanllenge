This is a `private` repository for VAST mini-challenge 1

The `framework.ipynb` is the main dashboard for data exploration, which we try to combine UI and Visualisation in this file with the minimum coding to keep it easy to follow. The actual codes must be written in separate files (usually in object-oriented style) in their related directories (ui, charts, graphutils).

For each new idea, create a new draft branch for your work to keep your branch up-to-dated.
When you are happy with your output, remove extra (debugging codes and files) from your branch or make a new branch before do pull request to the main branch. Otherwise, you can modify files on the main branch one by one and copy-paste only the needed codes to the main branch.
